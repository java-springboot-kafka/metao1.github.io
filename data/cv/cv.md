## Description
As a third-party employee, I was developing the core machine to be called SMSC ( SMS Center Server) , 
Server Monitoring as User Interface, and Traffic Agent Server as the core sever, to enhance the 100,000
message per second transaction to be replaced with the proior HUAWEI and ZTE license which was restricted to 
100 message per second transaction. The goal was bridge the gate to other mobile operators. Rightel increased its 
customers and users so broadcasting the services was an issue with this posed limitation. Prior servers and 
licenses didn't allow Rightel to increase its services and act as an individual part.To put out the old license my 
aim was to restructure the business logic.I restructured the protocols, like charging algorithms (mixed-up with prior 
one,Diameter,etc) to be deployed as a customized protocol and to have better transaction service.

Developing the business-layer application to increase SAN Storage Enhancement residency. While the company's server 
was increasing, the services and information was increasing as well, so residency of the proper location of the 
new server in SAN storage was always an issue to increase performance as much as possible.
Also clustering and big data optimization was other matter to be deployed in big servers. In term of maintenance, 
servers need to be accessed every time in datacenter. So, in our team, we created a platform to simulate the
best position of the new storage or server before placement in SAN storage by creating many
test cases and gadgets written in Java in a web-based environment.
