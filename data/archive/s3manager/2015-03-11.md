# Amazon S3 Free File Manager

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) is probably the most advanced storage system in the world. Amazon Web Services today becomes one of the best all-in-one web services. It's pretty obvious from the Amazon docs that how S3 works, but just give you an example that how it works,is like when you are working with any amount of data you like "expanding" and you pay as you go while increasing your amount of data. To be exact,the one reason that Amazon became so popular is behind the strategy of this unique business. [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) has lots of services ( about 40 or more ) and S3 which stands for Storage is just one of the main infrastructure of this scenario.

Amazon enhanced a [SDK](https://github.com/aws) ( Software Development Kit), which are all open source.

These SDK have implemented over many common programming languages( Like Java,JavaScript,CSharp,Lua,etc). Whichever programming languages you are using you can pick one of these SDK and develop your own services or tools over it.

Amazon has proposed a bare concept in Cloud industry. The IaaS concept for operating the servers over services,which of them could go on or off. If you just enable one service like S3 you feel that you are in one end-point as user and there is a hard-drive in another end-point, and a security and support wall between these end-points! This is a abstract view of S3, the transparently to user and feel in this way makes a reliable scene of durability and favorably.

However AWS ( Amazon Web Services ) are so amazing to work with, the problem of developing hasn't been enhanced pretty well. For instance, the dealing with S3 is like you make some branches in your S3 ( called "bucket") and done, there is not a suitable uploading tool. When you want to upload a huge amount of data, in hierarchy, Folders and files, the problems come. You have to create the folders manually on S3 console panel and then upload your files down there. This is painful,however, these strategies of dealing with Amazon Web Services wasn't seemed to be their goal.  

Because I was working with S3 a lot, it prompted me thinking of creating a free and open source tool to manage files. This tool is working both for AWS S3  and local  server storage  management.

I developed the codes on JavaScript and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and 
the complete source code is available at [Github](https://github.com/metao1/s3manager)
## How to install:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/metao1/s3manager

$ npm install 

$ node bin/www
```
I hope you enjoy using it and contribute in this project to develop it for other usage as well.
