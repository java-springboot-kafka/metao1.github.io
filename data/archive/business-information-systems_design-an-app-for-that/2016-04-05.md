## Business Information Systems: Design an App for That

###  Designing Information Systems

#### Many Meanings of Design

The key to successful information systems is good design. But what makes a good design? 
A number of disciplines weigh in on this topic. We will look at design from a number of different perspectives. 
Whenever possible we will contrast good and bad designs.

Different people use the word design in different contexts. When IS professionals speak of design, they are referring 
to business processes. Problems must be analyzed and requirements documented before solutions are designed, developed, 
and implemented. After all if the design does not satisfy the business need, then what’s the point? However, satisfying 
the business need is really a baseline standard. The vilified hospital system described earlier meets the business need
of registering patients. And yet its design is in other ways lacking. Similarly, fast food meets the need for feeding 
one’s hunger. However, we want to be metaphorically better than fast food in our designs.

Usability describes how easy the system is to navigate. The easier the system is to navigate, the less time a user will 
need to spend learning to use the system. A more usable system also leaves less room for error. Usability theory 
provides rules of thumb (heuristics) that document best practice conventions for designing a user interface.
Amazon.com has one of the most usable online systems because they follow established conventions.
Following conventions tremendously increases the potential acceptance of your website or app.

Graphic design refers to the visual appeal and organization of the user interface. 
There is obviously some overlap here with usability. Usable systems typically adhere to at least some graphic design 
rules. However, a usable system could be bland and uninteresting. Employing graphic design principles helps ensure 
that the system will have visual appeal. Designs also need to fit with the overall brand of the client. Existing colors,
fonts, and logos are all a part of the brand for which the system is being created.

Analytical Design describes how to best represent information—especially quantitative information—to communicate 
clearly and truthfully. Every information systems project has quantitative dimensions associated with project 
management. These include estimating costs, time schedules, and so forth.
Information systems are designed using the systems development life cycle (SDLC). The SDLC is to a large extent common 
sense spelled out in stages. First, analyze the current situation. Then specify the requirements that a solution should 
embody. The next stage is to design a solution (no programming yet). Then the system is developed (programmed) and
tested. Finally, the system goes live for the end users as it is implemented in the business setting. To review,
the five phases are:

* Analysis
* Requirements (vision of future state)
* Design
* Development
* Implementation

In this course we will cover all five stages. However we will focus most heavily on the first three stages for
two reasons. First, because that is where IS professionals tend to spend most of their time and second because
it is much easier to make changes to a system when in the planning stages, than after code has already been generated.

It is good to frequently interact with the end user and show them screen mockups and a systems architecture diagram
of what the final system will look like. The systems architecture is a hierarchy diagram of the flow of the website 
or app—what the relationship between the pages of the system will be. It is sometimes called a site map.
Ideally the systems architecture is done on paper with sticky notes that can be moved around at will by multiple users.
A final systems architecture can be represented as a hierarchy chart in PowerPoint.

Once the systems architecture is complete, wireframes or mockups of the individual pages may be constructed.
Mockups are non-functioning pages generated in a drawing program such as PhotoShop, Omnigraffle (Mac), 
or even PowerPoint. PowerPoint turns out to be a fairly respectable mockup tool—especially when working off of some 
predefined templates.
