# Avesty: Beautiful text chat for your community.
  
  In this article I want to talk about the biggest project I had done during my 4 years of
  hard working to build a fast chat server called "Avesty". Well it started to build the 
  fast gateway for a telecommunication I worked for. We call it "Gabrilio" because it was so fast. 
  It was wrote in Java and C combination,when I working on R&D department I wrote it however, 
  I couldn't convince my company where I was working for to use a faster chat server. 
  Although, Gabrilio was so fast, but it was design to work on point-to-point(p2p) mesh architecture.
  The company later decided to build a chat application, and this library needed to be customized to meet
  their needs. After all, I left the company to my city, but I know they didn't even try it.
  Anyway, the story went along with my experiences and efforts to build a fast chat server, which is also
  being used in any platform 'platform-free' literally.     
  Avesty to be said now provides this ability to be so fast and efficient, because of using modern technologies.
  I remember the time avesty ran on Amazon Servers, I got the excellent result in point of performance. 
  Efficient using of RAM,CPU and IO as well as little latency was the porpuse to achieve, which I was fortunately 
  successful in it.

  Avesty provides a free-to-use service and is also open-source [Avesty](https://github.com/metao1/avesty)
  Also I ran a [DEMO](https://eclipse-detail-8080.codio.io), on [codio](https://codio.com)
  which is a free service.Unfortunately the service goes down every time you close the 
  project window, and defiantly it is because of its terms of service for using free services.
  I previously ran the project on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com), but because it
  cost me so much I took it down. The reason for putting the Avesty for free was this,because 
  I could not afford its expenses lonely, and because lack of supporting and investment,I felt
  it could be better to share it to the glob and leave it as my experience.
  
  If youâ€™re planning to run a community chat room, you should try it out now!
  You can even embed Avesty room on your webpage/blog.
  
  I created Avesty to show how we can embed all the latest technology both in 
  Back-End and in Front-End. For this reason I used [engine.io](http://www.engine.io/)
  which I found much better than [socket.io](http://www.socket.io/) for get the best performances.
