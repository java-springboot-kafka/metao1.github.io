# WatchSite: a service for monitoring your web site
  
  Today I'm going to introduce my free service for everyone I know it's getting handy. 
  It's my effort to make free services for everyone.
  
  With Watch Site  you can monitor your websites, your servers and get notifications through email when
  something critical happened. It's also free for you to define your servers by signing in via Gmail.    
  
  - watchmen monitors health (outages, uptime, response time warnings, avg. response time, etc) for your servers.
  - ing types are pluggable. At this time, and are available.
  - watchmen provides custom actions through plugins (console outpug, email notifications, etc).
  
  
##### There's come some screenshots from the WatchSite Console, in conclusion:
