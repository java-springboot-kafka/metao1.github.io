# Design patterns
### Structural Adapter pattern
Ever tried to use a your camera memory card in your laptop. You cannot use it directly simply because there is no port in laptop which accept it.You must use a compatible card reader. You put your memory card into the card reader and then inject the card reader into the laptop. This card reader can be called the adapter.

A similar example is your mobile charger, or your laptop charger which can be used with any power supply without fear of the variance power supply in different locations. That is also called power “adapter”. 

In programming as well, adapter pattern is used for similar purposes. It enables two incompatible interfaces to work smoothly with each other. Going by definition:


```Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and its used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together. The object, that joins these unrelated interfaces, is called an Adapter.```
