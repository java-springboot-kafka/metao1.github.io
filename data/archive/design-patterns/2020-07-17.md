# Design patterns
Design patterns, as name suggest, are solutions for most commonly (and frequently) occurred problems while designing a software. 
Design patterns help developers efficiently solve common problems in their code. In this article, we learn how to apply design patterns to improve your efficiency in Java or Spring.
I examine the core patterns in play in the Java and Spring framework, as well as how to leverage the unique power of Spring—along with common object-oriented design patterns—to quickly solve problems. 
Learn how to leverage creational, structural, and operational patterns, as well as other framework patterns, when writing Java applications and working with Spring Framework.

### 1. Creational Design Patterns
Creational patterns often used in place of direct instantiation with constructors. They make the creation process more adaptable and dynamic. In particular, they can provide a great deal of flexibility about which objects are created, how those objects are created, and how they are initialized.

| Type   |      Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Builder | Builder design pattern is an alternative way to construct complex objects and should be used only when we want to build different types of immutable objects using same object building process
| Prototype | Prototype design pattern is used in scenarios where application needs to create a large number of instances of a class, which have almost same state or differ very little.
| Factory |	Factory design pattern is most suitable when complex object creation steps are involved. To ensure that these steps are centralized and not exposed to composing classes.
|Abstract factory |	Abstract factory pattern is used whenever we need another level of abstraction over a group of factories created using factory pattern.
|Singleton |	Singleton enables an application to have one and only one instance of a class per JVM.

### 2. Structural Design Patterns
Structural design patterns show us how to glue different pieces of a system together in a flexible and extensible fashion. These patterns help us guarantee that when one of the parts changes, the entire application structure does not need to change.    

| Type   |      Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
|<a href="/#/design-patterns-structural-adapter" target="_blank">Adapter</a> |	An adapter convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. It lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
|<a href="/#/design-patterns-structural-bridge" target="_blank">Bridge</a> |	Bridge design pattern is used to decouple a class into two parts – abstraction and it’s implementation – so that both can evolve in future without affecting each other. It increases the loose coupling between class abstraction and it’s implementation.
|Composite	| Composite design pattern helps to compose the objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
|Decorator |	Decorator design pattern is used to add additional features or behaviors to a particular instance of a class, while not modifying the other instances of same class.
|Facade |	Facade design pattern provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
|Flyweight |	Flyweight design pattern enables use sharing of objects to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. A flyweight is a shared object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously. The flyweight acts as an independent object in each context.
|Proxy |	In proxy design pattern, a proxy object provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. Proxy is heavily used to implement lazy loading related usecases where we do not want to create full object until it is actually needed.

### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.    

| Type   |      Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
|Command|	An adapter convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. It lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
|<a href="/#/design-patterns-structural-bridge" target="_blank">Bridge</a> |	Bridge design pattern is used to decouple a class into two parts – abstraction and it’s implementation – so that both can evolve in future without affecting each other.
